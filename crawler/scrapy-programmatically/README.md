Read more about it in the blogpost [here](http://kirankoduru.github.io/python/running-scrapy-programmatically.html).

>If you are really interested in running your scrapers programmatically please look at my new project [arachne](https://github.com/kirankoduru/arachne), it allows you to run your scraper spiders without the hassles of a program but from a __python pip package__
